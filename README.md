Health tracker in java

We want to create an app that enables users to track data about health factors like sleep and exercise, as well as receive recommendations for how to change their current habits and become healthier. 

We want users to be in control of their progress, so they can set goals for themselves and track their progress reaching those goals through a progress index. 
Optimizing the user’s progress index would allow them to maximize their individual performance and positively impact their health. 

## To get started
Run java file `GUI.java` or `GUIDemo.java`

## Instructions:
A user could first Sign Up and enter some basic information (ex: Name, Age) for tracking purposes, or Login if they’ve already made an account. Once in the app, users have the option to track their sleep or exercise data by inputting the start and end times for their session (date is recorded automatically). In the “Track Goals & Progress” panel, users can both see and update their current Goals, as well as look at their progress index and related recommendations based on how they’re doing.
